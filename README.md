# astr260L_2
Assignment repository for the ASTR260L week 2.

Welcome to your first set of Class Tasks! This weeks aim to get you familiar with two very import modules in Python: Numpy and Matplotlib. As usual, the whole set of Class Tasks is worth 50 points, and points are allocated clearly below, broken down by section and by question. There are two sections to this Class Task sheet, and each section is worth 50%. The first section contains questions about Numpy and the second section contains questions about Matplotlib. 
    
Once you have completed these questions, please upload the code and any other documentation (i.e. plots or data files) to the Git Classroom. The repo you receive in this weeks link should be empty, save a README file with these notes within it.
    
The deadline for these Class Tasks to be completed is Friday 22nd January at 5pm HST. I will not mark anything that I see in the Github repos before then, so you may use this as a place to store work in progress without worrying it may only be partially marked. Answers to these tasks and the quiz will be provided early next week and I will aim to mark your work and have it returned to you by lab next week (Wednesday 27th January).
    
Please submit your answers in the form of one, or more, .py files that I can run to output the print statements requested in the questions. Please also include a .txt document with the print statement outputs from each question, in case I cannot get your code to run. Please upload any plots or data files as the file type requested in the question, also include any answers to questions that provide a text response. If there are lots of print statements in your code, please use print('\\n') to create a new line between every question. You are also encouraged to include print statements throughout your code to let me know what you are doing, it is easier for me to give you points when I understand your process. This may seem arbitrary now, when the questions can be solved in one line of code, but it will come in handy later, when writing functions etc. 
    
NB: This particular homework contains a lot of creating arrays and doing things with them. Please name your arrays wisely do you don't get mixed up :)
